# AWS Compute Optimizer and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-compute-optimizer"></a>

AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of your AWS resources\. Resource examples include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances and Auto Scaling groups\. Compute Optimizer reports whether your resources are optimal and generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads\. For more information about Compute Optimizer, see the [AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/what-is.html)\.

## Service\-linked roles created when you enable integration<a name="integrate-enable-slr-compute-optimizer"></a>

The following [service\-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) are automatically created in your organization's accounts when you enable trusted access\.
