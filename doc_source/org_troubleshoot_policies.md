# Troubleshooting AWS Organizations Policies<a name="org_troubleshoot_policies"></a>

Use the information here to help you diagnose and fix common errors found in AWS Organizations policies\.

## Service Control Policies<a name="tshoot-scp"></a>

Service control policies \(SCPs\) in AWS Organizations are similar to IAM policies and share a common syntax\. This syntax begins with the rules of [JavaScript Object Notation](http://www.json.org) \(JSON\)\. JSON describes an *object* with name and value pairs that make up the object\. The [IAM policy grammar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-grammar.html) builds on that by defining what names and values have meaning for, and are understood by, the AWS services that use policies to grant permissions\.

AWS Organizations uses a subset of the IAM syntax and grammar\. For details, see [Service Control Policy Syntax](orgs_reference_scp-syntax.md)\.

### More than one policy object<a name="morethanonepolicyblock"></a>

An SCP must consist of one and only one JSON object\. You denote an object by placing \{ \} braces around it\. Although you can nest other objects within a JSON object by embedding additional \{ \} braces within the outer pair, a policy can contain only one outermost pair of \{ \} braces\. The following example is ***incorrect*** because it contains two objects at the top level \(called out in *red*\):

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": 
  {
     "Effect":"Allow",
     "Action":"ec2:Describe*",
     "Resource":"*"
  }
}
{ 
  "Statement": {
     "Effect": "Deny",
     "Action": "s3:*",
     "Resource": "*"
  }
}
```

You can, however, meet the intention of the preceding example with the use of correct policy grammar\. Instead of including two complete policy objects, each with its own `Statement` element, you can combine the two blocks into a single `Statement` element\. The `Statement` element has an array of two objects as its value, as shown in the following example: 

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
      "Resource":" *"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This example cannot be further compressed into a `Statement` with one element because the two elements have different effects\. Generally, you can combine statements only when the `Effect` and `Resource` elements in each statement are identical\.

### More than one Statement element<a name="morethanonestatement"></a>

This error might at first appear to be a variation on the error in the preceding section\. However, syntactically it's a different type of error\. In the following example, there is only one policy object as denoted by a single pair of \{ \} braces at the top level\. However, that object contains two `Statement` elements within it\.

An SCP must contain only one `Statement` element, consisting of the name \(`Statement`\) appearing to the left of a colon, followed by its value on the right\. The value of a `Statement` element must be an object, denoted by \{ \} braces, containing one `Effect` element, one `Action` element, and one `Resource` element\. The following example is ***incorrect*** because it contains two `Statement` elements in the policy object:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
    "Resource": "*"
  },
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "Resource": "*"
  }
}
```

Because a value object can be an array of multiple value objects, you can solve this problem by combining the two `Statement` elements into one element with an object array, as shown in the following example:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
      "Resource":"*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
 ]
}
```

The value of the `Statement` element is an object array\. The array in the example consists of two objects, each of which is a correct value for a `Statement` element\. Each object in the array is separated by commas\.

### Policy size limit<a name="policysizelimit"></a>

An SCP generated by the Policy Generator can be invalid once edited manually. The Policy Generator adds one object per service into the policy `Statement` as seen in following example: 

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
        "Sid": "Stmt1",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "ec2:*"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "*"
        ]
    },
    {
        "Sid": "Stmt2",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "s3:*"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "*"
        ]
    }
 ]
}
```

An SCP generated with the Policy Generator can be above the permitted [size limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_reference_limits.html#min-max-values) for an SCP. If such an oversized policy is edited manually, saving is no longer possible.

The `Statement` can be reduced in size by removing the unnecessary details and collapsing the objects into smaller ones as shown in the following example:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "s3:*
      ]
      "Resource":"*"
    }
 ]
}
```
